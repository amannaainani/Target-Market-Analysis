# Target-Market-Analysis-using-Python
A Capstone Project for CADS Junior Data Scientist Programme
This project is a group project completed by 5 members of Junior Data Scientist, a programme curated by The Centre of Applied Data Science (CADS).
We were given 2 days to analyse and process the customers' information before we proceed to build predictive models using Machine Learning algorithms including 
Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbours and Support Vector Machine. 
The outcome of this project was based on our predictions for potential customers that either will make a purchase or not after we send them advertisement.
Since cost of advertisement was taken into account, correct prediction resulted in positive returns (gains) and wrong prediction resulted in negative returns (losses).
The total number of gains and losses will directly impact our business' revenue and total value.
